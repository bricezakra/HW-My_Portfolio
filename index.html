                    My name is Brice Zakra. I am a Full Stack Developer with a steady background in Python and some accurate knowledge of the MEARN Stack (MongoDB.js – Express.js – Angular.js – React.js – Node.js) for backend technology. I have a Master’s degree in Computer
                    Science – Cybersecurity from the Universiy of Maryland University College. I am an
                    <a href="https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/transcript.aspx?transcript=3DD3RSHKCEF4QBCT">AWS(Amazon Web Services) Certified Developer – Associate</a> and a Cloud Developer. I am currently attending a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp
                    with the University of Texas – Austin to improve my coding skills. I am also a veteran of the US NAVY.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have discovered my love for coding while pursuing my studies and working on various security and penetration testing projects. Python is the first programming language that I have apprehended. Since then, I have been exposed to many others such as JavaScript
                    and GoLang (that I am actually still learning since it is fairly new). I have a good understanding of my data structures and algorithms. I am passionate about Technology. I am eager to learn and I am always willing to contribute to
                    any open-source project in my spare time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an adept of the AGILE values and principles methodology. I have an excellent ability to work well with others and independently as necessary. I have a remarkable analytical and problem solving ability with a strong leadership. You can learn more
                    about me by checking out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio Page</a>. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via my <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> page.
